# Mirrack: The Interactive Open-Source Smart Mirror

The name **Mirrack** is a combination of the words **mirror** and **hack** and represents taking back control of your old devices and to make them into something not only useful again, but something you love to use. This open-source smart mirror project is designed specifically for low-power laptops, and made to be as easy to set up as possible. Built with C# and Avalonia, Mirrack features a clean, modular interface that displays useful daily information like calendars, to-do lists, alarms, and weather. Mirrack uses Arduino buttons and Vosk for offline voice commands to interact with the device, allowing you to control the device rather than having a static display.

The project includes a custom Arch Linux ISO for a hassle free, keyboard free setup, allowing users to turn an outdated device into an interactive home assistant with minimal effort and cost.

## 🚧This Project is under development and is not yet complete.🚧

Stay tuned for updates on the project! It is currently scheduled to have a full version on 8/12/25
